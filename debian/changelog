php-mail-mime (1.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #588295, #575671).
  * Adopting the package (Closes: #575524).
  * Standards-Version is now 3.9.1.
  * Now depends on debhelper 7.
  * Section is now php.
  * Added Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser since I'm using the pkg-php git repo.
  * Added a new debian/source/format.
  * Rewrote debian/copyright so that it's formated correctly and includes all
    the authors.
  * Removed useless README.Debian that didn't add more info than what was in
    the debian/control file.
  * Removed debian/upstream-changelog as I wont have time to maintain such file
    that by the way is useless, as everyone that knows PEAR a bit also knows
    that such information is always available on pear.php.net if it is
    absolutely needed.
  * Rewrote debian/rules nearly from scratch, as the old one was pretty bad.
    Sorry if I'm not documenting all changes to this file here, but really,
    it's close to a full rewrite.
  * Now Build-Depends-Indep: php-pear because I'm using the pear cli tool to
    install this pear package in debian/php-mail-mime.
